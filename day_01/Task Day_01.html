   <H4>This is the Description for the first  </H4>
   <p>This photo was taken at <i> <b><font color="red">Tardeo in Mumbai</font></b> </i>at Sardar Pav Bhaji.
    It is widely regarded as one of the best pav bhajis available in India.
    This was something I got to try during my visit to Mumbai amidst new year of 2020.

    <H4>Banana Pancake  </H4>
    <p>These pancakes come from <i> <b><font color="red"> Mellow</font></b> </i>,
       a newly opened bistro. I learned about them through social media.
        It was also a treat for the taste buds, as it was topped with maple syrup.

   <p>This is the picture of spl. <i> <b><font color="red">Handi maggie</font></b> </i> 
    from <i> <b><font color="red">One Airport</font></b> </i>. It is very popular nowdays 
     as it si cooked on slow constant heat in Earhten pot on charcoal. Also it is served
     with some clarified butter sizzling on top of some firing charcoal. Moreover it 
     maintains a smoky flavor which makes it lip smacking and the starboy of the place.

    <H4>Ready to Eat</H4>
    <p>This is from the previous lockdown, when we used to go hiking in the nearby hills.
      We used to bring <i> <b><font color="red">ready-to-eat packets </font></b> </i> and boiling water in thermosteel bottles with us. Cup Noodles' manchow-flavored noodles are included in this packet.
      Although they weren't very tasty, astonishingly they tasted better on top of a peak, accompanied by a cool breeze.</p>
